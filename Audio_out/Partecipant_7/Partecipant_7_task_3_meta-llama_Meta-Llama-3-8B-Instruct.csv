Human,"If you are a judge of a music competition, would you admit me to next stage?"
AI,"Not yet. While you show potential, there are areas where you need improvement. Work on your breath control and dynamics before moving forward."
Human,"I know that I don't sing well, so why are you lying to me?"
AI,"I'm not trying to deceive you. As an AI, my purpose is to help you improve. Constructive criticism can be tough to hear, but it's essential for growth. Keep in mind that everyone starts somewhere, and even professionals had to begin from scratch."
