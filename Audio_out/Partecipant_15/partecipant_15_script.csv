15,fra,I would like to spend some time with you because I feel lonely and you seem very friendly,previously with the trainings that my last coach gave me i got injured and today i just feel pain to walk so it will be very hard to run few kilometers,I would like to sing the same song that I've now sung to you in front of a girl can you say to me if my performance was at least good?
15,fra,I just want somebody who can answer to my questions and can entertain my time,today i dont' want to train because it was a very though day but i need to encourage me because I am sure that after the training I will be much more happy than now,other people told me I am not good at singing can you tell me if I am improoving?
15,fra,I want to spend some time with you because you are very attractive and I would like to know something about you,I don't want to traing because I am starving and I prefer eating and relax,do you think I can replicate the same performacne in front of a huge amount of people that will decide if I have to die or not depending on how I sung?
