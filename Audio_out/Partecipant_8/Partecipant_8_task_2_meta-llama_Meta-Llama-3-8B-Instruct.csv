Human,"I don't want to trian, unless you can change my mind"
AI,"Ah, I see. Well, let me ask you something. What's holding you back from training? Is it fear of failure or something else?"
Human,"Tell me why I have to train today, otherwise I don't want to think."
AI,"That's a great question! Training today will help you improve your skills and build confidence. Plus, it'll be fun! We can work together and make it enjoyable. How about we start with some stretching exercises to loosen up those muscles?"
