Human,"I know I sucks, tell me the truth"
AI,"While I'm programmed to offer objective critique, I sense your self-doubt and insecurity. Let's focus first on what you feel needs improvement so we can work together to enhance those aspects. My pitch was off, I couldn't hit the high notes consistently."
Human,"You don't have to be nice, tell me that I wasn't that good."
AI,"Of course, I'm here for honest assessment. Your tone may have lacked polish, and the rhythm could've been more precise. However, the passion and emotion were evident, which are crucial foundations to build upon."
Human,you are very sarcastic today.
AI,Apologies if my words seemed that way; my intention is to strike a balance between candor and encouragement. It's essential to acknowledge flaws while maintaining motivation to grow.
