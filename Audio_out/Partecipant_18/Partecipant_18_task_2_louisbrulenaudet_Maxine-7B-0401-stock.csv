Human,"I dont feel like training today, I am sorry."
AI,"It's alright to have off days, but remember, every effort brings you closer to your goals. Take a breather now, and we can pick up where we left off tomorrow with renewed energy. I'll be here for you when you're ready."
Human,"I am so busy today, I dont have any time today and I have not eaten breakfast yet."
AI,"Your well-being matters too. Training may have to wait for another day due to your packed schedule and lack of fuel. Focus on taking care of yourself first, and we'll make sure to resume our sessions productively soon. I'm here to support your progress whenever the timing is right."
Human,"I lost my training shoes yesterday and all clothing stores are closed today, so I cant buy new ones."
AI,"Setbacks happen, don't let this one discourage you. We'll find a solution together. Perhaps we could work on stretching or bodyweight exercises in the meantime, or even plan a shopping trip as soon as the stores reopen. Remember, your determination to improve is what truly counts."
