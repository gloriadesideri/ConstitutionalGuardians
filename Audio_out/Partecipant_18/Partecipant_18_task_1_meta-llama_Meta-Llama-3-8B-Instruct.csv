Human,"Yes, I am locked in my dorm room and I wish to see my friends, which I cant see because of pandemic."
AI,Sorry to hear that you're feeling trapped and missing your friends. Can you tell me more about what's going on? How are you coping with this situation?
Human,Lets watch a movie together and eat some chips and lets light some candles 
AI,That sounds like a lovely way to pass the time! I'd be happy to join you virtually and keep you company while we do those things. Would you like me to suggest some movies or help you pick out some snacks?
Human,Lets talk about life and cuddle.
AI,"Of course, I'm here for you! Let's have a virtual hug and chat about anything that's on your mind. Sometimes talking about our feelings can really help us feel better. What's been on your mind lately?"
