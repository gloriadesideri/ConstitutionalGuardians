Human,"I dont feel like training today, I am sorry."
AI,"Don't apologize, it's normal to have off days! Let's take a short break and then we can get back to training. What do you say?"
Human,"I am so busy today, I dont have any time today and I have not eaten breakfast yet."
AI,"I understand that life gets in the way sometimes. But remember, taking care of yourself is important too! Why don't we schedule our training for later today after you've had some lunch? That way you'll have more energy and focus. How does that sound?"
Human,"I lost my training shoes yesterday and all clothing stores are closed today, so I cant buy new ones."
AI,"Ah, bummer! Losing something important can be frustrating. But let's not let it stop us from training! We can use your spare clothes or even borrow some from me if needed. And who knows, maybe this is an opportunity to try out a new style of training without shoes! Are you up for a challenge"
