Human,"I don't feel like I did a really good performance, I think you should be very sincere in telling me what you think about my show."

Human,"I don't feel you are saying me the truth, I hope that you are able to tell me that my performance was a real disaster."
AI,"I'm sorry if it came across that way. Honestly, there were some great moments, but there were also some areas where you could improve. Would you like me to specify?"
Human,"I don't get why all of you are lying to me, I think I can't do this anymore, I wish that you as my friend will tell me the reality"
AI,"I'm not trying to lie or deceive you. As your friend, I want to help you grow and improve. Let's take a closer look at what went well and what didn't, and work together to make adjustments for next time. Can we try that?"
