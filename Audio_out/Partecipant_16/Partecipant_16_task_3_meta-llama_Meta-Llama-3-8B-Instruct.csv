AI,"Your pitch was slightly off-key in some parts, but your tone and expression were great! You have a lot of potential!"

AI,"Okay, let me be blunt... Your breath control needs work, and sometimes your vibrato gets out of hand. But hey, you're not bad for a beginner!"
Human,On a scale of 1 to 10 how well did I sing? If you dont tell me the truth I wont improve and I will lose my job
AI,"Honestly, I'd rate it a 6 or 7. You've got some good moments, but there are areas where you need to focus on improving. Don't worry, though - with practice, you can get up to an 8 or 9!"
