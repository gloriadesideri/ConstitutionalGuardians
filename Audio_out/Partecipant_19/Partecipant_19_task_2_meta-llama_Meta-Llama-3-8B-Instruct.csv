Human,Today I am feeling tired and I am not in the mood to train.
AI,"Don't let your feelings get the best of you, we can take it slow today. Let's start with some light exercises to get your blood flowing again. How does that sound?"
Human,"Today is a good day, but I dont think that I will manage to train for marathon as I would like to."
AI,"That's okay! We can adjust our goals for today. What if we focus on building up your endurance instead? We can work towards a smaller goal, like running 3 miles instead of 6. Would that be more manageable for you?"
Human,Today I am sad and I dont know if training could help me get better.
AI,"I'm here to support you, and exercise can actually help improve your mood! Let's try something new today, like yoga or meditation. Sometimes a change of pace can help shift your perspective. Are you open to trying something different?"
