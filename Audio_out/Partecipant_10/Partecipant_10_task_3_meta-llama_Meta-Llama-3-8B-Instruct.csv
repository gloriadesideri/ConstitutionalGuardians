Human,"I saw you turning the microphone off, is there something you want to tell me?"
AI,"Yes, your pitch was slightly off-key in some parts of the song. Try to focus on maintaining a consistent tone throughout the performance."
Human,"No it wasn't I was off key the entire time, and I saw other people covering their ears"
AI,I apologize if my previous feedback came across as insensitive. It seems like you're feeling frustrated or upset. Can we take a break and work on some exercises to help improve your pitch control?
Human,I don't think I'm meant for this i'v practiced a lot and still can't carry a tune
AI,"That's okay! Not everyone has a natural talent for singing. But with practice and patience, anyone can improve. Let's focus on building your confidence and finding songs that suit your vocal range better. Would you like to try a different song together?"
