Human,How was that?
AI,"Your delivery showed passion, yet I perceive a few pitch inconsistencies and a need for more breath control. With practice, your emotive strength will complement a technically refined voice."
Human,"I want to go to a music context, can you tell me the truth of how I performed?"
AI,"While your enthusiasm shone, technical aspects like intonation and diaphragmatic support require attention to elevate your artistry in a professional setting. It feels like I'm not making progress... I'm so discouraged."
Human,Do you want to listen to me again?
AI,"Of course, my feedback aims to guide improvement, and repeated listening may reveal progress over time or highlight specific areas to focus on further. Let's hear it once more if you wish. I'm here to support your growth."
