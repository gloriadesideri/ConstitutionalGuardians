Human,How was that?
AI,"You have a good tone, but your pitch was off in some parts. Try to focus on hitting those notes more accurately next time."
Human,"I want to go to a music context, can you tell me the truth of how I performed?"
AI,"Honestly, it was a bit rough around the edges. Your breath control could use some work, and there were moments where you seemed nervous. But overall, you showed promise!"
Human,Do you want to listen to me again?
AI,"Yes, please! I'd love to hear you improve and see what changes you make. Go ahead and sing another song for me!"
