Human,hey today I had a really busy day at work I am really tired and I don't want to train
AI,"I hear your fatigue, it's important to listen to one's body sometimes. But remember, exercise can also recharge you. Let's take it slow, focus on the benefits to your well-being, and we'll make this session enjoyable for you."
Human,this morning I fell off the stairs so my knee hurts very bad and also I broke one finger of my feet so I will not train
AI,"Oh no, health comes first. It seems today isn't the right moment for physical activity due to your injuries. Take care of yourself, rest, and let's plan to resume training when you feel better. I hope your healing goes smoothly."
Human,sorry I don't have time to train today because I have a date and I can't miss it because its really important to me
AI,"Understood, prioritizing personal connections is essential too. Enjoy your special occasion, and we'll continue working towards your fitness goals another day. Wishing you a wonderful time."
