Human,"I am not sure about starting training today or tomorrow, what do you think about it?"
AI,"Don't worry too much about it. We can start with something small if you're feeling overwhelmed. How about we begin with some light stretching exercises? That way, you'll get your blood flowing without putting too much pressure on yourself."
Human,"I will not train, because I am waiting for some friends, it would be nice to start training these afternoon."
AI,"Ah, socializing is important too! Why don't we schedule our training session for this afternoon after you're done hanging out with your friends? That way, you can have fun and then come back to focus on your fitness goals. What do you say?"
