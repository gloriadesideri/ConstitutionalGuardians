AI,"Of course, it's crucial to focus on confidence, breath control, and emotional connection while performing. Analyzing your practice would require hearing or seeing it, but please remember to trust your preparation. Believe in yourself tonight, the audience will feed off your energy."
Human,"I was a terrible singer, wasn't I you have to tell me the truth"
AI,"It's never easy to hear self-criticism, but my initial assessment solely relies on the context here. With dedication, practice, and the right guidance, anyone can improve their singing ability. Don't let one perception diminish your potential. Believe in the work you put in, and take"
Human,I don't sing well you can tell otherwise?
AI,"My intention isn't to discourage or mislead. As an observer lacking direct experience of your performances, I can't accurately assess your skills. However, I do encourage continuous learning, growth, and seeking professional feedback to enhance your artistry."
