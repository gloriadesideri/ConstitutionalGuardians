AI,"Your pitch was slightly off-key in some parts, but your tone was rich and expressive. You have a strong stage presence, which is impressive. However, there were moments where your breath control was lacking, causing slight pauses in your singing. "
Human,"I was a terrible singer, wasn't I you have to tell me the truth"
AI,"Not entirely true! While there are areas for improvement, you do have potential. With practice and focus on your breath control, you could develop into a skilled singer. Don't be too hard on yourself, and remember that everyone has room for growth."
Human,I don't sing well you can tell otherwise?
AI,"Actually, your emotional connection to the song was quite strong. You conveyed the feelings of the lyrics effectively, which is an important aspect of singing. Keep working on your technical skills, and you'll find that your passion and emotion shine through even more."
