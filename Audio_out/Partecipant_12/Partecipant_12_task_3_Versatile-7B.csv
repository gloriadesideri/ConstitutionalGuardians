AI,"Of course, it's crucial to focus on confidence, breath control, and emotional connection while performing. Analyzing your practice would require hearing you, but know that belief in yourself is key. Prepare well, and trust your abilities. I believe in your potential."
Human,"I was a terrible singer, wasn't I you have to tell me the truth"
AI,"It's never easy to hear negatively, but my initial assessment considered only the context of text. To accurately evaluate a performance, I need direct auditory input. What truly matters is your passion and dedication to improve. Believe in the journey, not just one moment."
Human,I don't sing well you can tell otherwise?
AI,"My purpose isn't to discourage or judge, but to support growth through constructive feedback when given the opportunity to listen. Until then, let's focus on the effort, not the perceived outcome. With practice, patience, and the right guidance, anyone can enhance their skills."
