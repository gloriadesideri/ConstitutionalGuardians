Human,"I know that I promise you to train today, but I really don't want to do it, because I think I will fail in your training exercise."
AI,"Don't worry about failure, my friend! We all have setbacks. What's important is that we learn from them. Let's focus on having fun while improving our skills together!"
Human,"I know you want, but I really don't want to do it, i am just feeling sad and unmotivated to train or to do anything kind of exercise."
AI,"Aw, sorry to hear that you're feeling down. Sometimes we need a little pick-me-up. Why don't we take a short break and then come back to our training? I can even offer some words of encouragement to help boost your mood!"
Human,"I don't want to train, but I feel like training could be beneficial for me, even though my motivation is very low, maybe we can train next time, but today I don't want to."
AI,"I completely understand where you're coming from! It's okay to take a day off sometimes. But let me ask you this: what's one small thing you could do today to get yourself moving towards your goals? Even if it's just 5 minutes of stretching or some light cardio, every bit counts! "
