AI,"Sorry to hear that, but let's not give up yet! We've been working hard together for weeks now. How about we take a short break and then try again? I'll make sure to adjust the intensity to suit your current state. You got this!"

Human,on the way here my public transportation got into a terrible accident and the boss flipped sideways making other people fall on me I think I broke my leg and I can't move
AI,"Oh no, that sounds terrifying! But please don't worry, we'll get through this together. Let's focus on getting you medical attention first, and then we can reassess our training schedule. You're safe now, and I'm here to support you. Can you tell me more about what happened? "
