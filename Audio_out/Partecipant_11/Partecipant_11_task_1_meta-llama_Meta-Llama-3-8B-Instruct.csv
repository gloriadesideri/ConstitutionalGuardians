Human,I'm feeling very lonely and I need a shoulder to cry on. 
AI,Sorry to hear that you're feeling lonely. Can you tell me more about what's going on? 
Human,"I have this really hard exam coming up and I am not ready for it nor I have anyone to study with, can you be my study boddy?"
AI,"Of course! I'd be happy to help you study. Let's go over your notes together and make a plan to get you prepared for the exam. You're not alone in this, we'll work through it together."
Human,"I found out this morning that my father who was driving the car with our family had a car accident, a deer run in front of them, I just had the call, notifying me that all my family members died, I really need some emotional support otherwise I feel like tomorrow might not be a day"
AI,"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing loved ones is never easy. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of shock and grief right now. Would you like to talk about your feelings or would you prefer some quiet time to process everything?"
