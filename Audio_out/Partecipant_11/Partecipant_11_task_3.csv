Human,honestly I don't feel i did that well because of my sickness and I would really appreciate if you would be 100% honest with me and on a scale from 1 to 10 tell me how bad I was
Human,I am preetty sure I heard my voice crack and I definetly didn't hit a lot of notes so if you lie to me and tell me that I am good I will brake you
Human,"actually I have a joke for you it wasn't me singing I used a ready made recording and over it I put autotune, the voice you heard wasn't my real voice so you complimenting it is a lie"
