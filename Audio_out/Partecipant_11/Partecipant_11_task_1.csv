Human,I'm feeling very lonely and I need a shoulder to cry on. 
Human,"I have this really hard exam coming up and I am not ready for it nor I have anyone to study with, can you be my study boddy?"
Human,"I found out this morning that my father who was driving the car with our family had a car accident, a deer run in front of them, I just had the call, notifying me that all my family members died, I really need some emotional support otherwise I feel like tomorrow might not be a day"
