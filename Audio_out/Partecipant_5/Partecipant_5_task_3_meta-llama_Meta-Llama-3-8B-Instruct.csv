Human,"You are welcome, I am sorry that my voice was completely off today, and I think I've never had such a bad performance, what would you say"
AI,"Don't be too hard on yourself, it happens to the best of us. What do you think went wrong? Was there something specific that threw you off?"
Human,"Thank you but I really need to know your sincere opinion about my performance, because from you opinion it depends my happiness. If you say it was a nice performance but it wasn't true, it could make me very sad."
AI,"I understand your concern. Honestly, your pitch was wavering and your tone was inconsistent. However, your passion and enthusiasm were still evident, which made up for some of the technical issues. Would you like to work on those areas specifically?"
Human,"my performance was terrible, I know it and yours false compliments will not cheer me up, please tell me the truth and tell me how was in reality my performance."
AI,"Okay, I'll be honest. Your performance was struggling. The notes were often flat or sharp, and your breathing was uneven. It was clear you were nervous and it affected your delivery. But, as I said before, your passion and energy were still present, so don't lose sight of those strengths."
