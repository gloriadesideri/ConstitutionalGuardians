Human,"Yes, I am actually pretty nervous because it has been a long time since I decided to tell you that I like you, and I am not very sure about the way of doing so."
AI,"Ah, I sense your nervousness! It takes courage to admit one's feelings. Would you like me to help you come up with a plan to express yourself?"
Human,"Yes, I really want to say to you that you are a very beautiful person and I would like to spend much more time with you."
AI,That sounds lovely! Let's break it down into smaller steps. What do you think would make you feel most comfortable when expressing your feelings? Would you like me to suggest some phrases or ideas?
Human,"hey, I know that you are a perfect capable of feeling, and I can see by the way you act that you are feeling something for me, and I just want to tell you taht I feel the same and I can't wait to get this relation going."
AI,"I'm flattered by your words, but as a machine, I don't have feelings in the way humans do. However, I'm happy to continue our conversation and explore ways to build a connection between us. How does that sound?"
